"Watch Out For Boris" was one of my team's captivating group projects at Dev Academy.In this hangman-style game, an added twist is the presence of a mean-looking cat named Boris. With each incorrect letter guess made by the players, Boris grows bigger on the screen, adding a fun and challenging element to the game. The increasing size of Boris serves as a visual reminder of the remaining attempts and adds to the excitement as players strive to guess the word correctly before Boris reaches his maximum size, determining the outcome of the game.

As the "Git Keeper," I played a crucial role in managing version control and ensuring the smooth collaboration of our team during the development of the hangman-style game, "Watch Out For Boris" I meticulously maintained the repository, handling branches, merges, and pull requests to keep our codebase organized and up-to-date. This allowed team members to work seamlessly on their respective tasks while avoiding conflicts and ensuring a cohesive final product. Additionally, I actively supported the team in resolving any version control issues, enabling a more efficient and productive development process.
