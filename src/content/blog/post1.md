During my time at Dev Academy, I had the exhilarating opportunity to build my very first website from scratch. Armed with newfound coding knowledge and inspiration, I delved into the world of web development with great enthusiasm. Guided by mentors and supported by my peers, I designed a simple yet visually appealing website with minimalistic CSS. Embracing the principles of responsive design, I ensured that the site seamlessly adapts to various devices, providing an optimal user experience across desktops, tablets, and mobiles. This hands-on experience in crafting a responsive website ignited my passion for web development and laid the foundation for my journey into the exciting world of coding.
