During my time at Dev Academy, my team and I took on the challenging task of building a Hasbro "Game of Life" clone with a delightful cat theme. As the vibes watcher in the group, I ensured everyone's energy and enthusiasm remained high throughout our project. Our goal was to create an engaging turn-based board game using the React-based SERN stack, allowing players to earn "treats," purchase property, and make life-altering decisions. 

To tackle this project, we organised a full-day planning session and divided our development into sprints, starting with a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and then adding additional features. I contributed to the game logic and overall app structure, utilising technologies such as React, Knex, Express, Vite, Zustand, React Query, Typescript, and CSS. 

As we progressed, the project's scope expanded, presenting us with new challenges. We had to adapt our plans on the fly and learn new technologies like Zustand to solve unique problems. Despite the obstacles, we forged ahead and presented our creation to an audience of family, friends, and peers. I helped with preparing and overseeing our presentation, as well as helping create essential assets for the showcase.

This project proved to be a valuable learning experience for me. As the vibes watcher, I discovered the significance of maintaining a positive team dynamic and how it positively impacted our productivity. I also learned valuable lessons about leadership, teamwork, and the limitations of certain technologies. Sometimes, we faced seemingly insurmountable challenges that couldn't be solved through sheer thinking. 

Though our current implementation of the game isn't functional, I am determined to rebuild it and fundamentally redesign the game engine. My plan is to incorporate a ticker that periodically checks the game state, which I believe will help us overcome the issues we encountered previously. This project has been an exciting adventure filled with growth and valuable insights, and I am eager to continue refining my skills and tackling new challenges in the future.
